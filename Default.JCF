;Sections defining Text Unit Navigation parameters
;These modify the way cursors move and retrieve text units such as words and sentences
;rules with a name of the form [TextUnitRuleSet CursorName] will be the default rule for a given cursor
; Note that UserBuffer, Lotus and FSDom virtual cursors all use the name VirtualPCCursor
;Richedit 1.0 cursor used for richedit 1.0 applications when Enhanced edit mode is on use the name Richedit1Cursor.
;All apps using the FSDom Edit 2 cursor such as Richedit 2.x and higher with Enhanced edit mode use FSDomEdit2Cursor.
;All cursors which don't have their own section use the default rule.
;Note that if a window class name follows the cursor name, that rule set will be used when that cursor is active for that window class.
;rules which are not linked to a cursor and class must be switched to via scripts using the SwitchToTextUnitRuleSet function.
;Note WordSymbols are symbols which constitute a word by themselves
;There are two types:
;1. WordStandAloneSymbols: if the cursor lands on one of these and it has other symbols either side of it, the single symbol is treated as a word. This is
;useful when a text editor moves from symbol to symbol with control left or right arrow and we thus only want to hear the symbol being landed on.
;2. WordRunSymbols: If the text editor moves from the first punctuation symbol in a run of symbols to the next alphanumeric or group of symbols, then the
;whole run of consequtive symbols are treated as a single word.
;Even though WordSymbols may be defined, they will only be honoured if the BreakAtWordSymbols option is on, otherwise other rules take precedence.
;the MathMode option must be on for the Math Operators and operator binding to take effect.
;Precedence: math rules, WordSymbols, numberSeparators, left/right delimiters.
;note a right or left delimiter is kept with the text that preceeds it or follows it.
